# Front End Engineering Challenge

GA is designing a new site for K-12 learners to access GA courses and content. Use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to develop a responsive navbar with login/logout. You can start with the code in index.html or create your own project.

## Requirements:

- Demonstrate use of web standards including HTML5.  
- Use a separate CSS file.   
- Make the navbar responsive with at least one breakpoint (your choice as to how it looks on a smaller screen width).   
- Follow the style guidelines listed below.  
- Add buttons or links to login/logout.  

## Bonuses

- Use SASS or LESS to pre-compile your CSS.   
- Add a CSS animation with transitions.   
- Use JavaScript to control whether the login or the logout button is shown; only one should be visible at a time.  

## Styling Guidelines

- Use the "Roboto" Google font   
- Use the following colors   
	- Page background: #FFFFFF    
	- Default/normal font color: #494949   
	- Navbar background: #83EDD9
